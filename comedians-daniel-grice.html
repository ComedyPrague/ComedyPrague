<p>Daniel Grice is originally from Newcastle in England and has been trying to
get home for the last 10 years, but as he doesnâ€™t understand how international
travel works he is stuck here. He has no problem making a fool of himself for
the adoration (or pity) of others and was one of the first graduates from the
Comedy Prague new comedian workshops and has been gigging since Autumn 2015.
His influences are wide ranging from Eddie Izzard to Ross Noble and everything
in between.</p>
