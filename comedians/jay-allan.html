<p>Jay is an enthusiastic Canadian who has been living in Prague for the last 3 years. 
Although he is proud of his country, he tired of the long, cold winters and dreamed of life in Europe. Here in Prague, 
most of his time he works as an English teacher. He also works as a tour guide during the summer months, trying his best to get 
some of the tourists away from Dave.
<br>
Creatively, he has studied filmmaking in Canada – writing, directing, and producing – as he loves the movies. 
Since coming to Prague, he has begun to work as a performer – actor, narrator, and finally, as a stand-up comedian. 
Come hear about his experiences and perspectives through his unique humor and jokes. He loves the sound of laughter and hopes to 
spread a little joy in pessimistic central Europe.</p>
