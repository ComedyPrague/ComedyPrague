  From the great state of New Jersey, Sean is typical of his state. He worked
  as a special education teacher, as a high school vice principal in Mexico
  and is now an elementary school teacher in Prague. Typical Jersey.

  When not battling with the present perfect, Sean tries to bring laughter
  and maintain his status as being pretty well-adjusted (for a stand-up comedian).
