<p>David Talacko is torn between, on the one hand, having two hands, and, on the other, having a spare. 
As well as doing stand-up, he is a musician, amateur cricketer, runner (for trams), teacher and businesses man. 
He has lived in Prague since the days when a beer cost 6 crowns and the benefits of graffiti hadn’t been fully realised. 
Last Tuesday while cooking vepøo-knedlo-zelo, he went into the living room to get some scissors but when he got there he 
couldn’t remember why he had left the kitchen – he still can’t quite remember but thinks it might have something to do with 
dinosaurs. His influences in comedy include, among many, Eddie Izzard and Billy Connolly.</p>
