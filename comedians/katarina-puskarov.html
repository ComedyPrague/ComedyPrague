<p>Katarina was born and bred in Belgrade but considers herself a citizen of the world as the Czech Republic is only the fifth country in which she had a chance to reside, and she still does! Katarina has had a long experience as a theatre actor during her student days in English, French and Serbian. She decided to dedicate herself to the stand-up comedy as it perfectly combined her love towards the stage and just about everything silly. Therefore, she thought it was high time she presented some of her material to the people, and maybe, just maybe, the people might think it’s funny!</p>
