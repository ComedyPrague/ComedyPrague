<p>Scott Lee Hansen has been a Stand up comic for far too long. He was the first
and hopefully won’t be the last English stand up comic in The Czech Republic.
His first show “The Angličan” in 2007 was performed totally in mangled Czech.
After 40 shows Scott realised he could also be funny in English and has never
looked back (unless there’s a sudden commotion behind him). His Musing are
amusing and the jokes Puntastic. Scott is also Czech’s Doctor Who Geek
Extra-ordinaire performing geek related comedy to crowds of women dressed
as men and and men dressed in tin foil.</p>
