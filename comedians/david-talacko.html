<p>David Talacko is torn between, on the one hand, having two hands, and, on the other, having a&nbsp;spare.
As well as doing stand-up, he is a&nbsp;musician, amateur cricketer, runner (for trams), teacher and businesses man.
He has lived in Prague since the days when a beer cost 6 crowns and the benefits of graffiti hadn’t been fully realised.
Last Tuesday while cooking vepřo-knedlo-zelo, he went into the living room to get some scissors but when he got there he
couldn’t remember why he had left the kitchen – he still can’t quite remember but thinks it might have something to do with
dinosaurs. His influences in comedy include, among many, Eddie Izzard and Billy Connolly.</p>
