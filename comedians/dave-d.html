<p>Dave is a new stand-up comedian from central England. He moved to Prague 4 years ago as part of a desperate attempt to avoid office work back home. Dave began life in Prague as an English teacher, teaching private in-company lessons to adults all around the city. Realising that this still involved going into offices, he then started working as a walking tour guide, where he decided he really enjoyed public speaking. It was from this that Dave decided to try his hand at stand-up comedy, after noticing that he was too busy telling jokes on his tours rather than giving any factual information about the city at all. Dave has been interested in comedy since he was a child, growing up watching sitcoms and going to stand-up shows with his dad.</p>
