<p>Meet the one and only Simon Says.
<br>
Simon has various talents, one of them is being good at children’s games, although his manager strongly urges 
everyone not to take part in them, especially when Simon is the one giving orders.
<br>
He tried to become a professional organisor of children games, but he went bancrupt … three times in a row. 
This was one of many dead ends he has met in his life time.
<br>
Never the less this has given him great life lessons and stories. 
When talking about what happens to him at work with friends, he realized, that people like to laugh at all the 
nasty things that happen to others. At this point he decided to fully commit himself to the observation of life to it's 
fullest and tell everyone about it on stage.
<br>
Nowadays he spends most of his time staring out of a window on tram number nine with his pen and notebook close to his chest. 
Spending his days like this he is hoping to get inspiration and some good gags, while observing life on the streets.</p>
