<p>Luke Ryan is a stand-up and improv comedian and MC from Ireland and has been
living in Prague since 2010. Luke started in comedy in 2004 and has performed
all over Ireland, central Europe and even Argentina and Colombia. Luke is an
English teacher in a primary school and his days are constantly full of
laughter and a complete lack of understanding about is really going on in life,
which suits Luke just fine because it is business as usual.</p>

<p>Luke formed Comedy Prague in 2013 because it was cheaper than going
to a therapist. And there was a real need for English comedy in Prague.
His comedy influences are Dara Oâ€™Briain for the storytelling and the banter,
Dylan Moran for the surreal and the absurd and trying not to take life too
seriously in general. He is still not sure what he wants to be when he
grows up.</p>
