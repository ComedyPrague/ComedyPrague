Phil Micallef is an English person stuck in a weird limbo state between music and comedy.
He thinks music is a&nbsp;joke, but takes comedy very seriously, and so he has decided to find
a&nbsp;neat compromise between the two. The result is a gag-punctuated gallivant of songs
about various relatable hard-hitting issues, such as Czech politics, low-cost airlines and
loving a&nbsp;kebab a&nbsp;little bit too much.
