<div class="text">

<p>Comedy Prague was formed in April 2013 by Luke Ryan, a stand-up comedian from Ireland, who moved to Prague in 2010. 
  A comedian since 2004, Luke noticed that there was very little in the way of English stand-up comedy in Prague. 
  He set up Comedy Prague to provide regular English language comedy in Prague. 
  Comedy Prague started out with only occasional shows in Prague and has grown to running regular 
  monthly <a href="/events.html">shows</a> in different <a href="/venues.html">venues</a> around Prague.</p>

<p>Comedy Prague wants to continue developing by producing new shows in different areas of Prague in 2018. 
  Comedy Prague would also like to run shows in different parts of the Czech Republic following its first non-Prague show 
  in 2015 in Plzen, and later on in Brno. The Comedy Prague <a href="/comedians.html">performers</a> would 
  also like to perform outside the Czech Republic and some of its performers have already performed in Wroclaw in 
  Poland in conjunction with World-Wide Comedy and in Barcelona.</p>

<p>The Comedy Prague <a href="/comedians.html">performers</a> come from all over the world, from many 
  different cultures and backgrounds, united by two things, their love of comedy, and their love of making people laugh. 
  What started as only a handful of comedians, many of whom had very little experience, has developed into a strong team 
  of regular, experienced performers working together to help Comedy Prague develop and progress.</p>

<p>Comedy Prague also runs workshops to train people to become comedians. 
  The workshops focus on writing and developing material, as well as performance and stage technique. 
  Since June 2013, Comedy Prague has trained over 15 people as stand-up comedians, many of whom now regularly perform 
  stand-up comedy. In 2018, Comedy Prague will expand its workshops to include workshops for experienced comedians 
  to develop new material, and workshops to train comedians in improv comedy and how to MC.</p>
