<p>
  Comedy Prague was formed in April 2013 by Luke Ryan, a stand-up comedian from Ireland, who moved to Prague in 2010.
  A comedian since 2004, Luke noticed that there was very little in the way of English stand-up comedy in Prague.
  And so Comedy Prague was born.
  It started out with only occasional shows and has grown to regular
  monthly <a href="/calendar.html">shows</a> in different venues around Prague.
</p>

<p>
  Comedy Prague is made up of experienced and dedicated
  <a href="/comedians.html">performers</a> from all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  Comedy Prague also runs workshops to train new people to become comedians.
  The workshops focus on writing and developing material as well
  as performance and stage technique. In 2018, Comedy Prague will expand its
  workshops to include workshops for experienced comedians to develop new
  material, and workshops to train comedians in improv comedy and how to MC.
